\section{Style Guide}\label{sec:style-guide}

This section and subsections should be deleted from the final version of your report.  

\subsection{Headings}\label{sec:headings}

The Tufte-\LaTeX\ classes will emit an error if you try to use
\linebreak\Verb|\subsubsection| and smaller headings.

% let's start a new thought -- a new section
\newthought{In his later books},\cite{Tufte2006} Tufte
starts each section with a bit of vertical space, a non-indented paragraph,
and sets the first few words of the sentence in \textsc{small caps}.  To
accomplish this using this style, use the \Verb|\newthought| command:  
\begin{docspec}
  \doccmd{newthought\{In his later books\}, Tufte starts\ldots}
\end{docspec}

\subsection{Sidenotes}\label{sec:sidenotes}
One of the most prominent and distinctive features of this style is the
extensive use of sidenotes.  There is a wide margin to provide ample room
for sidenotes and small figures.  Any \Verb|\footnote|s will automatically
be converted to sidenotes.\footnote{This is a sidenote that was entered
using the \texttt{\textbackslash footnote} command.}  If you'd like to place ancillary
information in the margin without the sidenote mark (the superscript
number), you can use the \Verb|\marginnote| command.\marginnote{This is a
margin note.  Notice that there isn't a number preceding the note, and
there is no number in the main text where this note was written.}

The specification of the \Verb|\sidenote| command is:
\begin{docspec}
  \doccmd{sidenote[\docopt{number}][\docopt{offset}]\{\docarg{Sidenote text.}\}}
\end{docspec}

Both the \docopt{number} and \docopt{offset} arguments are optional.  If you
provide a \docopt{number} argument, then that number will be used as the
sidenote number.  It will change of the number of the current sidenote only and
will not affect the numbering sequence of subsequent sidenotes.

Sometimes a sidenote may run over the top of other text or graphics in the
margin space.  If this happens, you can adjust the vertical position of the
sidenote by providing a dimension in the \docopt{offset} argument.  Some
examples of valid dimensions are:
\begin{docspec}
  \ttfamily 1.0in \qquad 2.54cm \qquad 254mm \qquad 6\Verb|\baselineskip|
\end{docspec}
If the dimension is positive it will push the sidenote down the page; if the
dimension is negative, it will move the sidenote up the page.

While both the \docopt{number} and \docopt{offset} arguments are optional, they
must be provided in order.  To adjust the vertical position of the sidenote
while leaving the sidenote number alone, use the following syntax:
\begin{docspec}
  \doccmd{sidenote[][\docopt{offset}]\{\docarg{Sidenote text.}\}}
\end{docspec}
The empty brackets tell the \Verb|\sidenote| command to use the default
sidenote number.

If you \emph{only} want to change the sidenote number, however, you may
completely omit the \docopt{offset} argument:
\begin{docspec}
  \doccmd{sidenote[\docopt{number}]\{\docarg{Sidenote text.}\}}
\end{docspec}

The \Verb|\marginnote| command has a similar \docarg{offset} argument:
\begin{docspec}
  \doccmd{marginnote[\docopt{offset}]\{\docarg{Margin note text.}\}}
\end{docspec}

\subsection{References}
References are placed alongside their citations as sidenotes,
as well.  This can be accomplished using the normal \Verb|\cite|
command.\sidenote{The first paragraph of this document includes a citation.}

The complete list of references may also be printed automatically by using
the \Verb|\bibliography| command.  (See the end of this document for an
example.)  If you do not want to print a bibliography at the end of your
document, use the \Verb|\nobibliography| command in its place.  

To enter multiple citations at one location,\cite{Tufte2006,Tufte1990} you can
provide a list of keys separated by commas and the same optional vertical
offset argument: \Verb|\cite{Tufte2006,Tufte1990}|.  
\begin{docspec}
  \doccmd{cite[\docopt{offset}]\{\docarg{bibkey1,bibkey2,\ldots}\}}
\end{docspec}

\subsection{Figures and Tables}\label{sec:figures-and-tables}
Images and graphics play an integral role in Tufte's work.
In addition to the standard \docenv{figure} and \docenv{tabular} environments,
this style provides special figure and table environments for full-width
floats.

Full page--width figures and tables may be placed in \docenv{figure*} or
\docenv{table*} environments.  To place figures or tables in the margin,
use the \docenv{marginfigure} or \docenv{margintable} environments as follows
(see figure~\ref{fig:marginfig}):

\begin{marginfigure}%
  \includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{helix}
  \caption{This is a margin figure.  The helix is defined by 
    $x = \cos(2\pi z)$, $y = \sin(2\pi z)$, and $z = [0, 2.7]$.  The figure was
    drawn using Asymptote (\url{http://asymptote.sf.net/}).}
  \label{fig:marginfig}
\end{marginfigure}
\begin{Verbatim}
\begin{marginfigure}
  \includegraphics{helix}
  \caption{This is a margin figure.}
\end{marginfigure}
\end{Verbatim}

The \docenv{marginfigure} and \docenv{margintable} environments accept an optional parameter \docopt{offset} that adjusts the vertical position of the figure or table.  See the ``\nameref{sec:sidenotes}'' section above for examples.  The specifications are:
\begin{docspec}
  \doccmd{begin\{marginfigure\}[\docopt{offset}]}\\
  \qquad\ldots\\
  \doccmd{end\{marginfigure\}}\\
  \mbox{}\\
  \doccmd{begin\{margintable\}[\docopt{offset}]}\\
  \qquad\ldots\\
  \doccmd{end\{margintable\}}\\
\end{docspec}

Figure~\ref{fig:fullfig} is an example of the \Verb|figure*|
environment and figure~\ref{fig:textfig} is an example of the normal
\Verb|figure| environment.

\begin{figure*}[h]
  \includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{sine.pdf}%
  \caption{This graph shows $y = \sin x$ from about $x = [-10, 10]$.
  \emph{Notice that this figure takes up the full page width.}}%
  \label{fig:fullfig}%
\end{figure*}

\begin{figure}
  \includegraphics{hilbertcurves.pdf}
%  \checkparity This is an \pageparity\ page.%
  \caption{Hilbert curves of various degrees $n$.
  \emph{Notice that this figure only takes up the main textblock width.}}
  \label{fig:textfig}
  %\zsavepos{pos:textfig}
  \setfloatalignment{b}
\end{figure}

Table~\ref{tab:normaltab} shows table created with the \docpkg{booktabs}
package.  Notice the lack of vertical rules---they serve only to clutter
the table's data.

\begin{table}[ht]
  \centering
  \fontfamily{ppl}\selectfont
  \begin{tabular}{ll}
    \toprule
    Margin & Length \\
    \midrule
    Paper width & \unit[8\nicefrac{1}{2}]{inches} \\
    Paper height & \unit[11]{inches} \\
    Textblock width & \unit[6\nicefrac{1}{2}]{inches} \\
    Textblock/sidenote gutter & \unit[\nicefrac{3}{8}]{inches} \\
    Sidenote width & \unit[2]{inches} \\
    \bottomrule
  \end{tabular}
  \caption{Here are the dimensions of the various margins used in the Tufte-handout class.}
  \label{tab:normaltab}
  %\zsavepos{pos:normaltab}
\end{table}

\subsection{Full-width text blocks}

In addition to the new float types, there is a \docenv{fullwidth}
environment that stretches across the main text block and the sidenotes
area.

\begin{Verbatim}
\begin{fullwidth}
Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet...
\end{fullwidth}
\end{Verbatim}

\begin{fullwidth}
\small\itshape\lipsum[1]
\end{fullwidth}
